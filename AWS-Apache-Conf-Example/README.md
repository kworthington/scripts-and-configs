An example Apache 2.4 configuration file for example.com, using PHP-fpm. This works well on AWS with an EFS.

Paths, email addresses, and all instances of example.com should be replaced with your specific needs.

The config assumes that you are using https, and want all traffic redirected from http:// http://www and https://www to https://example.com
